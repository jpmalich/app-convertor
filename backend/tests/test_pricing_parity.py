"""Iter 36 pricing-refactor parity test.

Locks the post-refactor IDENTICAL_PRICES / ZERO_PRICED / PER_TIER_PRICES
structures (in catalog_seed.py) to the historical TIER_PRICES values
captured at the time of the refactor. If anyone later edits a tier
price WITHOUT touching the right source-of-truth dict — or if the
computed TIER_PRICES view ever drifts — this test fails.

Run with: cd /app/backend && pytest tests/test_pricing_parity.py
